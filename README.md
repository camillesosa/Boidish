# Boidish

Left click on page to make witch move from one location to another.  Pumpkins are NPCs and will remain in place until interaction with player character occurs.
Currently have 2+ sprites interacting; Pumpkins will follow the witch if she gets close enough.

Not yet implemented:
2 ideas/plans to attempt boids, either add rain/snow and give it boid attributes or make the pumpkins follow the witch in a boid-like way.
